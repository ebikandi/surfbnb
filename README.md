# üèÑ surfbnb
Platform to rent surfboards from users instead of buying a new one to emphasize reutilization and reduce the carbon footprint of making a new board.

## Introduction 
This is just a pet-project to practice and introduce these practices and techniques:
- Model the domain using Domain Driven Design.
- Use Hexagonal Architecture to decouple layers from each other.
- Decouple bussiness behavior using CQRS.
- Vertical slicing of the increments.
- TDD.


### Disclaimer
Please, take into consideration that this project's single goal is just practice and I would do it in pair-programming if could üòî. Thus, it's main focus will be on using the techniques listed above. Some would probably delay putting the prototype in production and increase it's complexity, so validating and receiving feedback from the user would be too late.

As I strongly believe that **code is just liability and just a means to an end, which is to deliver value to the user**, in real world scenario the approach I would take would more lean and the first prototype would be much simpler to put the app available for all the users, just to iterate it in many small steps.
